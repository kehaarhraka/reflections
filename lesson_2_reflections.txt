What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intialize a repository, a hidden directory named ".git" is created. That directory will contain meta data about the repository including commits and files in the commit. No commmits are created intially.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area can contain a subset of files from the working directory. It can contain all the files in the working directory but it doesn't have to do so. The staging area allows you to pick and choose which files you want to commit and when while leaving other files in the working directory untouched.
